This repository is about data manipulation
I was provided with the Telco Customer Churn dataset, in which I was tasked with answering the following questions:

1. Remove rows with tenure equal to 0 (meaning, the data to be analyzed in this exercise consists of rows where tenure is NOT equal to 0).
   How many rows are now available in our dataset?
2. For customers who DO NOT HAVE A PARTNER and DO NOT HAVE DEPENDENTS, what is the average tenure?
3. For customers who HAVE A PARTNER and DO NOT HAVE DEPENDENTS, what is the maximum MonthlyCharges recorded?
4. How many customers DO NOT HAVE A PARTNER but HAVE DEPENDENTS?
5. What is the average TOTAL CHARGES for NON-SENIOR CITIZEN customers (Senior Citizen = 0) who have PHONE SERVICE and FIBER OPTIC INTERNET SERVICE?

These questions are related to data manipulation, where data manipulation involves performing various operations on the dataset to filter, transform, and analyze the data in order to derive meaningful insights and answers to the posed questions. Data manipulation may include tasks such as filtering rows, calculating statistics, and transforming variables to make the data suitable for analysis.
